## Who am I?
Hey! My name is Mr. Habib and I am a teacher @ Father Michael Goetz in Mississauga.
I am a graduate of York University’s Bachelor of Education program and McMaster University’s 
Honors Computer Science program with a minor in Mathematics. Throughout my undergraduate degree, 
I volunteered at three catholic youth group programs and worked as a counselor at a stay-away 
summer camp named Camp Ozanam. Though I had a passion for Computer Science and technology, 
I had an even greater passion for learning with the youth. York allowed me to combine my love 
of teaching with my passion for Computer Science to make my current vocation a reality.

I currently enjoy thinking about and planning creative ways to share my knowledge of the field 
of Computer Science only slightly more than I love creating software that solves complex problems 
in a simple way. I have a passion for convincing everyone I meet that no one is a “math person” 
and that Maths is a beautiful and creative discipline.

## Why am I here?
This GitHub is a place to store my assignments, walkthroughs, and to manage class asignments.
Anything that I work on that is related to teaching, like little scripts to help mark, or
a potential LMS that I want to make with FireBase + Elm, will be here as well!
